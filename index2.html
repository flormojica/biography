        <h2> Future Plans </h2>
        <p> My future plans are very complex and will probably get blocked by life but, I plan on going to either IUPUI or IU Bloomignton after High
            School and double majoring in Computer Science and Business. After that I plan on working in Computer Science for a good amount of time 
            and hopefully saving up to begin law school. One of my ambitions is to become an immigration lawyer, but, with the surplus of immigration 
            lawyers there are now. I would most likely be a buisness lawyer, which is my secondary choice. I plan on using my computer science 
            skills and hopefully my business degree to later on open my own law firm and go into private practice as I grow older.</p>

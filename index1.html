        <h2> Hobbies </h2>
        <p> I have many hobbies and interests which also include after school activities. After school I am part of the marching band and the Pep band,
            I have been part of these clubs for two year now. I have played the clarinet for a total of 4 years. Other activities I have been part of 
            include: Mock Trial, Student Council, Student Ambasador, 4-H and Model UN. I have been apart of the mock trial team for a total of 
            3 years and plan on doing it for one more year. Every year I have been both a witness and a lawyer. I have been an ambassador for my 
            school for the past 2 years. I give tours around the campus for 7th and/or 8th graders to show them the different programs and classes

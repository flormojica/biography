    <h2> About Me </h2>
      <p>Hello, </p>
          <p>My name is Flor Mojica. I'm the daughter of two immigrants that migrated here in order to give me and my brothers a better 
          life. Although we have struggled a lot throughout the years we end up in a pretty good condition. I am bilingual and i'm working on 
          being trilingual. I am fluent in English and Spanish and I know a little bit of French. I have two brothers. The youngest is a 
          Freshman at Arsenal Tech High School and the oldest one is a Sophomore also at Arsenal Tech. I am the class of 2019 at Arsenal Tech.
          I will be graduating this year with the Academic Honors Diploma. I am very involved at my school and I do many other actvities after 
          school. You could basically call me a busybody. </p>

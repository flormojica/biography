    <h1> Flor's Biography </h1>
    <h3> About Me </h3>
      <p>Hello, my name is Flor Mojica. I'm the daughter of two immigrants that migrated here in order to give me and my brothers a better 
          life. Although we have struggled a lot throughout the years we end up in a pretty good condition. I am bilingual and i'm working on 
          being trilingual. I am fluent in English and Spanish and I know a little bit of French. I have two brothers. The youngest is a 
          Freshman at Arsenal Tech High School and the oldest one is a Sophomore also at Arsenal Tech. I am the class of 2019 at Arsenal Tech.
          I will be graduating this year with the Academic Honors Diploma. I am very involved at my school and I do many other actvities after 
          school. You could basically call me a busybody. </p>
      <h3> Hobbies </h3>
      <p> I have many hobbies and interests which also include after school activities. After school I am part of the marching band and the Pep band,
          I have been part of these clubs for two year now. I have played the clarinet for a total of 4 years. Other activities I have been part of 
          include: Mock Trial, Student Council, Student Ambasador, 4-H and Model UN. I have been apart of the mock trial team for a total of 
          3 years and plan on doing it for one more year. Every year I have been both a witness and a lawyer. I have been an ambassador for my 
          school for the past 2 years. I give tours around the campus for 7th and/or 8th graders to show them the different programs and classes 
          we offer. Apart from the activities listed above I have been working since I was 15. I currently work at Broad Ripple Brewpub as a hostess.</p>
      <h3> Future Plans </h3>
      <p> My future plans are very complex and will probably get blocked by life but, I plan on going to either IUPUI or IU Bloomignton after High
          School and double majoring in Computer Science and Business. After that I plan on working in Computer Science for a good amount of time 
          and hopefully saving up to begin law school. One of my ambitions is to become an immigration lawyer, but, with the surplus of immigration 
          lawyers there are now. I would most likely be a buisness lawyer, which is the second choice I've made. I plan on using my computer science 
        skills and hopefully my business degree to later on open my own law firm and go into private practice as I grow older.</p>
